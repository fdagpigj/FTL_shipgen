# Requirements

- Python 3.5 or newer: install from python.org or a package manager
- Pillow: install with `pip install Pillow` in a command prompt
- FTL's original data files copied into a folder called `data_originals` and img files into a folder called `img_originals`

# Usage

Run it with `python main.py` (or `python3 main.py`) in a command prompt in this directory.

For now, that simply creates img and data folders which you can package into a .ftl file and install using Slipstream Mod Manager.
