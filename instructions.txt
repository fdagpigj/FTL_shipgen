#Requirements:

-Python 3.5 or newer: install from python.org
-Pillow: install with "pip install Pillow" in a command prompt
-FTL's original data files copied into a folder called "data_originals" and img files into a folder called "img_originals"

#Usage

Run it with "python randomize.py" (or "python3 randomize.py" if you have other versions of Python installed) in a command prompt in this directory.
That should (some day in the future, for now it just creates img and data folders) create or replace a file called "Random_Fleet.ftl" which you can install using Slipstream Mod Manager.
